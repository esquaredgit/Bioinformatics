Pictures and figures to be used in the report (line_labeled_5Cluster_Av.png is the primary model to be used for the clustering portion of the report). 

For the expression vectors we tested a couple of different cleaning methods:
1. We removed a vector from the matrix entirely if it was incomplete. Items using this data are marked "Rm" for "remove."
2. We also tried a version that obtained the average value for each column in the matrix and substituted this value for a blank space in the incomplete vector. In this way we were able to avoid losing any existing data. Items using this data are marked "Av" for "Average."
